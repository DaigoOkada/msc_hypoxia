This repository contains the analysis code used in the study:

Okada D. et al.,  
"Single-cell omics and stochastic modeling reveal hypoxia-driven population-level aging in cultured mesenchymal stromal cells"

The code includes scripts for:

- CITE-seq analysis
- scRNA-seq analysis
- DDP stochastic model simulation
- Figure generation

The scripts were used to generate the results and figures presented in the manuscript.
